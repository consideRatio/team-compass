## The JupyterHub team compass

This meta-repository is meant to help us organize ourselves across the many organizations,
projects, and use-cases in the JupyterHub community. It's meant to make the project more
welcoming, transparent, and inclusive. If you've got an idea for how this can be improved,
please reach out!

Most of the Team Compass lives in this website:

**GitHub repository status for several repositories**

The JupyterHub community tries to keep its documentation strong and its code coverage for tests relatively high. A **great** way
to contribute is to help improve either of these things. Below is a table of relevant information
and links for each of these.

## Planning and operations

Currently, the JupyterHub team is keeping track of the goings-on in the community
via the following main channels:

* A monthly team meeting on the third Thursday of every month
* Issues / PRs in the JupyterHub repositories
* The JupyterHub / Binder Gitter channels

*Note: any member of the community is welcome to participate in any of the process around discussion, archiving, and planning team meetings. Participate in whatever way works for you! Input is welcome!*

### Weekly Team Reports

The currently-active team report [exists in a HackMD](https://hackmd.io/MYNgpgHATAZgrAIwLQAYCMwAsTNhRJAThBQGYkoATEw0gQxgkroHYg==?view). Each week, team reports
are archived in the [weekly reports archive](http://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/weekly-reports/weekly_report_index.html). Then, a new report is created with the [team report template](http://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/weekly-reports/team-meeting.html).
